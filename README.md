# public-api-requests

Work in progress - Functionaly complete (pending more testing.) Still may add some UX mods for useability (for instance search results with no results currently don't let the user know no match exists. Also when a search returns an employee I added the ability to click the Awesome Employee Startup Directory header to reload the original 12 but no way for user to know that.)

Public api request created as part of Fullstack JavaScript Treehouse Techdegree program.

All JavaScipt files created and coded from scratch.

HTML, and CSS was provided as a basic structure and was further modified in an effort to learn and develop how to change/update/interact with design properties.
